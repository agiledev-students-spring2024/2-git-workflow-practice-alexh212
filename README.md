I decided to share  [ People are worried that AI will take everyone’s jobs. We’ve been here before.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/01/27/1087041/technological-unemployment-elon-musk-jobs-ai) by MIT Technology Review. 

I enjoy how it provides interesting historical context and connects them to concerns about automation, productivity, and job displacement.

The author explains that automation can replace workers' jobs, but notes that similar innovations can create many new jobs by *"augmenting [worker's] capabilities and expanding their potential to do new tasks."* 

This "augmentation" of our capabilities that is possible from AI reminds me of a quote by Melissa Sassi, global head of IBM Hyper Protect Accelerator, found [here](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/06/30/expert-essays-on-metaverse-possibilities/)

*"I see the rise of the digital twin and personalized ways of bringing AI and ML to life via our digital twins: a new definition of ‘in real life.’ We will continue to rely on technology to help us become more productive, more efficient, and able to virtually be in far corners of the world without physically being there."*


Really interesting stuff. Let me know what you think!

## Comments from Rongjian Wang
I really enjoyed reading this article. It references those past debates about development of technology being disruptive but ultimately leads to job creation. The piece suggests that current anxieties about AI and job displacement actually echo past sentiments, which creates new jobs and promotes economic growth in the long term. To better adapt with the age of AI, people might need to embrace some changes in their original works or cooperate with AI tools to become more productive.
